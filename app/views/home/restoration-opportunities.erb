  <h2>CARBON SEQUESTRATION &amp; FOREST RESTORATION POTENTIAL</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">What is the status of forest ecosystems and the restoration potential in my area of interest, and what is the maximum amount of carbon that this could sequester?</p>

      <p>The Carbon and Biodiversity Calculator provides both a visual overview and rough spatial quantification estimates of <a href="/about#forest_status">forest status</a> and <a href="/about#restoration_potential">restoration potential</a>. It includes data that on a global level estimates <a href="/about#forest_status">forest status</a> (intact forest, fragmented or managed forest, partially deforested areas, and deforested areas). <a href="/about#restoration_potential">Forest restoration potential</a> is also calculated for: a) wide-scale restoration (low population density and potential to support closed forest), b) mosaic restoration (moderate population density in a mosaic landscape with several functions), or c) remote restoration (population density less than one person per square kilometre within a 500km radius). Such information is relevant to those concerned with improving ecosystem resilience through appropriate restoration of forest ecosystems, as called for in <a href="http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-15/" target="_blank">Aichi Target 15.</a></p>
			
  <p>Estimates of <a href="/about#cseq">carbon sequestration potential</a> can also be calculated.  The Calculator determines estimates for maximum carbon sequestration potential through restoration on deforested and degraded land (assuming that all restoration opportunities were used, all activities were successfully implemented and sufficient time provided). While the actual gain in carbon is likely to be lower due to the limitations of reality, these estimate values can be helpful for an initial assessment, and help identify areas suitable for different types of restoration and those that have the potential to have both biodiversity and carbon benefits, as called for under <a href="http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-15/" target="_blank">Aichi Target 15.</a></p>

			<h4>Relevance for Convention on Biological Diversity</h4>
<p><strong>Target 15:</strong> By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks have been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.
