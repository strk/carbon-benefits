  <h2>Potential synergies between carbon and biodiversity: </h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Are there areas which are important both for biodiversity conservation and carbon storage in my area of interest?</p>

    <div class="left">
      <p>Ecosystems such as forests provide multiple services and functions. In addition to containing large amounts of carbon, natural forests are often biodiversity rich and provide important ecosystem services that bring both local and global benefits. The type and extent of biodiversity and ecosystem services vary with location and it can be useful to consider how these important ecosystem functions relate spatially.  This information could be helpful for users considering where climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation priorities can be addressed in coordination.</p>
			
  <p>The Carbon and Biodiversity Calculator include map layers of <a href="/about#carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="/about#kba">Key Biodiversity Areas</a>, <a href="about#protected_areas">protected areas</a>, <a href="/about#ecologycal">ecological gap analyses</a> (for a few countries), <a href="/about#forest_status">forest status</a>, <a href="/about#cseq">carbon sequestration potential</a> and <a href="/about#restoration_potential">forest restoration potential</a>. From this data, the Carbon and Biodiversity Calculator performs simple spatial analyses which can help the user explore synergies for, and gaps in, protection of high carbon density areas and/or biodiversity rich areas.</p>
	
<p>Such basic analyses can be helpful for users concerned with CBD <a a href="http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/" target="_blank">Aichi Target 11</a> which seeks to increase coverage of protected areas especially in areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Similarly, they can provide information to users who wish to consider what areas might be particularly important to protect from degradation of natural habitat, in line with the CBD intentions under <a a href="http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-5/" target="_blank">Aichi Target 5.</a></p>

			<h4>Relevance for Convention on Biological Diversity</h4>
			<p><strong>Aichi Target 5:</strong> By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.
				<a a href="http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-5/" target="_blank">Aichi Target 5</a>
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>Aichi Target 11:</strong>By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascape.
