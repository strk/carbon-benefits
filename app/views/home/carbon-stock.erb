  <h2>CARBON STOCK AMOUNTS AND DISTRIBUTION</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">What is the estimated amount of carbon stock within my area of interest, and how is it distributed?</p>
  
  
  <section class="two_columns">
    <div class="left">
      <p>Ecosystems store carbon in their biomass and in the organic fraction of their soils. Carbon density and its spatial distribution are both influenced by vegetation and soil types. Understanding the different carbon stocks, both in terms of density and spatial distribution, is important to identify how much and where biodiversity can contribute to climate change mitigation efforts.</p>
			
  <p>The underlyingcarbon datasets included in the Carbon and Biodiversity Calculator are largely global in scale, although some regional and national datasets have been used where
available, and may not lend themselves to local level interpretation in all instances. The tool is intended to be used for exploratory purposes and the calculated values are to be regarded as indicative. Nevertheless, different user groups can be informed about the estimated total amount of carbon in their area and how it is distributed. It can further be helpful for exploring carbon correlation with biodiversity for thinking around for example the achievement of the CBD Aichi Targets. <a href="http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-15/" target="_blank">The Aichi Target 15</a> requires, among other actions, the conservation of carbon stocks. The analyses can help the user gain an initial understanding of where current protection of ecosystems contributes to conservation of carbon stocks including aboveground and below ground biomass and soil organic carbon.</p>

			<p><strong>Target 15:</strong> By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks have been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.

              <p>Protected areas are defined as terrestrial or marine areas that are recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. This includes for example national parks and nature reserves.</p>
<p>
The Carbon and Biodiversity Calculator draws on the information in the World Database on Protected Areas.

              <p>An ecological gap analysis is an assessment of the extent to which a protected area system meets protection goals set by a nation or region to represent its biological diversity. In many cases, the assessment yields spatial data identifying ‘gaps’ in the current protected area system, i.e. areas of importance for biodiversity conservation that are not yet officially recognised as protected areas. The Carbon Calculator includes spatial data from ecological gap analyses in Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru.</p>

              <p>This dataset differentiates between intact forest, fragmented/managed forest (where potential closed forest has been converted into open forest), partially deforested areas (where potential forest has been converted into woodland with low tree canopy density) and deforested areas (where potential forest cover of different density has been converted into non-forest). It was derived from a map of potential forest extent using existing ecoregion/ecozone classifications, climate data, and information on current forest distribution.</p>
              <p>This dataset was jointly produced by the World Resources Institute (WRI), the South Dakota State University (SDSU) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on behalf of the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration (GPFLR).</p>

              <h6><a name="restoration_potential">RESTORATION POTENTIAL</a></h6>
              <p>This is a 1 km2 resolution dataset, showing wider landscapes where forest restoration opportunities are more likely to be found (rather than the location of potential restoration sites). The results are globally consistent, but pertain only to lands deemed capable of supporting forests or woodlands. Some areas of dry and very sparse forest fall outside of these lands but still provide significant needs and opportunities for restoration. The restoration potential of degraded and deforested land has been estimated depending on how densely the land is populated, its degree of urbanization or industrialisation, and on whether it is cropland or not Areas with high population density, or occupied by intensively managed croplands, were considered as having low/no restoration opportunities, while areas with scattered cropland areas, pastures, agroforestry and all types of forest plantations were considered as providing promising opportunities for restoration. The dataset differentiates between:</p>	
						<p><b>Promising opportunities:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Remote restoration: Less than one person per km2 within a 500km radius. These areas could be difficult to restore due to their remoteness.</p></li>
							<li><p>Wide-scale restoration: Less than 10 people per km2 and potential to support closed forest.</p></li>
						<li><p>Mosaic restoration: Between 10 and 100 people per km2, in a mosaic landscape with several functions.</p></li>
						</ul>
<p><b>Little / no restoration opportunities:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Agricultural restoration: Croplands or densely populated rural areas on former forest lands, with over 100 people per km2. They do not offer extensive restoration opportunities in terms of area, but some of these lands would benefit from having trees planted in strategic places to protect and enhance agricultural productivity and other ecosystem functions.</p></li>
</ul>

              <p>The dataset on carbon sequestration potential provides an estimate of the maximum amount of carbon that could be sequestered through restoration on deforested and degraded lands, if all restoration opportunities were used, all activities were successfully implemented and sufficient time provided. The dataset has been derived by comparing current estimates of carbon stocks with estimates for maximum carbon stocks for forest types by ecofloristic zone. It is important to note that the actual gain in carbon is likely to be lower due to a number of influencing factors, such as the potential impact of climatic conditions, actual time available and the way measures are implemented, which are too complex and manifold to be considered in the assessment.</p>
