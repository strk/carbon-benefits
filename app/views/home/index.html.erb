  <h2>Carbon &amp; Biodiversity Calculator</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">a joint product of The CBD Secretariat, LifeWeb and UNEP-WCMC</p>
	<p class="intro">The Carbon and Biodiversity Calculator allows you to define your area of interest and calculate an estimated contribution of this area to climate change mitigation. At the same time, it also provides information on the areaâ€™s conservation values, protected areas, forest status and opportunities for forest and landscape restoration.</p>

      <h4>MORE ABOUT THE TOOL</h4>
      <p>The <strong>Carbon and Biodiversity Calculator </strong> is an online tool that estimates the potential contribution of any selected area in the world to climate change mitigation by calculating the amount of ecosystem carbon currently stored there, as well as the amount of additional carbon that could be sequestered through forest restoration. Moreover, it links this information with the conservation value, protection and forest status of the area.</p>
      <p>In addition to the calculations, the tool lets you visualize the different data layers together or separately for any place in the world. You can turn the layers on and off, and change the order in which they are viewed. When you click on a protected area, you are also offered a link to more information about that area.</p>
      <p>The tool allows you to define your area of interest in three ways. You can draw a polygon around the area, upload your own spatial files, or select polygons of existing protected areas. For more complicated analysis, you can define several separate areas of interest. The Carbon and Biodiversity Calculator will provide you with an additional summary of values in the different polygons.</p>
      <p class="orange">Disclaimer: We advise cautious interpretation of values calculated by this tool. The underlying datasets are for most areas global in scale and may not lend themselves to local level interpretation. The tool is intended to be used for exploratory purposes and the calculated values are to be regarded as indicative.</p>
