  <h2>Carbon &amp; Biodiversity Calculator</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">a joint product of The CBD Secretariat, LifeWeb and UNEP-WCMC</p>
	<p class="intro">The Carbon and Biodiversity Calculator allows you to define your area of interest and calculate an estimated contribution of this area to climate change mitigation. At the same time, it also provides information on the areaâ€™s conservation values, protected areas, forest status and opportunities for forest and landscape restoration.</p>

      <h4>MORE ABOUT THE TOOL</h4>
      <p>The <strong>Carbon Calculator</strong> is an innovative online tool that informs about the potential contribution of any selected area in the world to climate change mitigation by providing initial estimates on the amount of carbon currently stored inside, as well as the amount of additional carbon that could be sequestered through restoration. </p>
      <p>Moreover, it links this information with the conservation value and forest status of the area. </p>
      <p>The tool allows users to draw a line around their area(s) of interest (AOI) around any area in the world, or select any protected area, and provides them with the information on several areas.</p>
      <p class="orange">Disclaimer: We advise cautious interpretation of values calculated by this tool. The underlying datasets are for most areas global in scale and may not lend themselves to local level interpretation. The tool is intended to be used for exploratory purposes and the calculated values are to be regarded as indicative.</p>
